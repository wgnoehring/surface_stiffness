        """Create a matrix for testing methods working on Hessian block matrices.

        Consider a `(Nx Ã— Ny)` grid of sites  labeled as follows:
        ```
        | [ 4 3 2 1 0]
        | [ 9 8 7 6 5]
        | ...

        | 
        | y
        | ðŸ •
        |  â†’ x

        We asume that the grid is periodic and construct a block matrix by
        computing for each pair of sites I, J `A * np.cos(dx / cutoff_radius
        * 0.5 * pi) * np.cos(dx / cutoff_radius * 0.5 * pi)`, where dx and
        dx, respectively, are the site distances along x and y, and A is a
        `block_size Ã— block_size` prefactor matrix.

        Parameters
        ==========
        Nx : int
            Number of sites along the x-direction
        Ny : int
            Number of sites along the y-direction
        cutoff_radius : int
            Interactions are cut off at this site distance. Must be less than half of 
            `Nx` and `Ny`.
        blocK_prefactors: numpy.ndarray
            Square 2D array with prefactors for the blocks.

        Returns
        =======
        h : numpy.ndarray
